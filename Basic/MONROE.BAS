120 A$(10)="   To the House of Representatives of the United States:
130 A$(11)="
140 A$(12)="     By a resolution of Congress approved on the 27th of
150 A$(13)="March, 1818, it was directed that the journal, acts, and
160 A$(14)="proceedings of the Convention which formed the present
170 A$(15)="Constitution of the United States should be published, under
180 A$(16)="the direction of the President of the United States,
190 A$(17)="together with the secret journals of the acts and
200 A$(18)="proceedings, and the foreign correspondence (with a certain
210 A$(19)="exception), of the Congress of the United States from the
220 A$(20)="first meeting thereof down to the date of the ratification
230 A$(21)="of the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and
240 A$(22)="the United States in the year 1783, and that 1,000 copies
250 A$(23)="thereof should be printed, of which one copy should be
260 A$(24)="furnished to each member of that (the Fifteenth) Congress,
270 A$(25)="and the residue should remain subject to the future
280 A$(26)="disposition of Congress.
290 A$(27)="     And by a resolution of Congress approved on the 21st
300 A$(28)="April, 1820, it was provided that the secret journal,
310 A$(29)="together with all the papers and documents connected with
320 A$(30)="that journal, and all other papers and documents heretofore
330 A$(31)="considered confidential, of the old Congress, from the date
340 A$(32)="of the ratification of the definitive treaty of the year
350 A$(33)="1783 to the formation of the present Government, which were
360 A$(34)="remaining in the office of the Secretary of State, should be
370 A$(35)="published under the direction of the President of the United
380 A$(36)="States, and that 1,000 copies thereof should be printed and
390 A$(37)="deposited in the Library subject to the disposition of
400 A$(38)="Congress.
410 A$(39)="     In pursuance of these two resolutions, 1,000 copies of
420 A$(40)="the journals and acts of the Convention which formed the
430 A$(41)="Constitution have been heretofore printed and placed at the
440 A$(42)="disposal of Congress, and 1,000 copies of the secret
450 A$(43)="journals of the Congress of the Confederation, complete,
460 A$(44)="have been printed, 250 copies of which have been reserved to
470 A$(45)="comply with the direction of furnishing one copy to each
480 A$(46)="member of the Fifteenth Congress; the remaining 750 copies
490 A$(47)="have been deposited in the Library and are now at the
500 A$(48)="disposal of Congress.
510 A$(49)="     By the general appropriation act of 9th April, 1818,
520 A$(50)="the sum of $10,000 was appropriated for defraying the
530 A$(51)="expenses of printing done pursuant to the resolution of the
540 A$(52)="27th of March of that year.  No appropriation has yet been
550 A$(53)="made to defray the expenses incident to the execution of the
560 A$(54)="resolution of 21st April, 1820.  The whole expense hitherto
570 A$(55)="incurred in carrying both resolutions into effect has
580 A$(56)="exceeded by $542.56 the appropriation of April, 1818.  This
590 A$(57)="balance remains due to the printers, and is included in the
600 A$(58)="estimates of appropriation for the year 1822.  That part of
610 A$(59)="the resolution of the 27th March, 1818, which directs the
620 A$(60)="publication of the foreign correspondence of the Congress of
630 A$(61)="the Confederation remains yet to be executed, and a further
640 A$(62)="appropriation will be necessary for carrying it into effect.
